EcoPlay is a game dedicated to raising awareness about recycling and correctly disposing of waste. It started out as a HackAThon project at the Spring 2024 Princeton HackAThon and we have been working on and off on the game since then. It employs a simple dropper type mechanic where the player is a recycling bin that collects garbage. The goal of the game is to maximize the amount of recyclable waste and avoid trash waste.

How it was built
This is coded entirely in Python and used only the pygame library. It employs a stack system, inspired by CDcodes (https://github.com/ChristianD37?tab=overview&from=2019-12-01&to=2019-12-31), states, OOP, and more to bring the game to life. All of the art and the soundtrack is completely original as well.

The most recent version of this project is TVer_3 which is a functional game with a working menu system. The work being done at this point is adding in all the features.
